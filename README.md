# Color Memory

## A React based memory game.

[Color Memory](https://seanneppl.github.io/colorMemory/) is a React based memory match game. When the page loads a new
palette is generated and populated on the page. Each tile displays its rgb color values and hex code. The user can then
click any tile, which increments the score and randomizes the tiles. The score will continue to go up as long as the
user clicks a new tile. Once the user clicks an old tile the score resets to zero. The game will keep track of the max score.
If the user wants to use a new palette for the game they can reload the page or click the "New Palette" button.
